# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

EXAMPLE 1) Good example - "Wins versus total payroll in the 2025 MLB regular season" found at https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/blue-jays-underdog-graphics-9.6950016 

I have classified this visual as "good" for the following reasons:
- Perceptual - I was able to underastand the message it was trying to portray. 
- Substantive - The visualization accurately represents the data.
- Aesthetic - It is a bit dull but the use of colour on only the relevant teams makes it easier to compare thhose teams.
- It had a clear title.
- When you hover over each team it gives you their exact number of regular season wins and total payrol data.
- Only the two teams everyone is focused on are in colour with all other teams in grey which makes it easier to compare them directly. 
- There are arrows with bold text showing the directions of "lower payroll" and "higher payroll" as well as "more wins" vs "fewer wins."

How could this data visualization have been improved?  

The vizualization could have been improved by making the title larger or in a different colour to make it stand out more. Also, it is not reproducible, but given the topic and source, most of the public is unlikely to look at that.  

  
EXAMPLE 2) Bad example - "Obamacare Enrollment" from https://flowingdata.com/2014/04/04/fox-news-bar-chart-gets-it-wrong/ 

I have classified this visual as "bad" for the following reasons: 
- Substantive - The visualization does not accurately represent the data.
- The two bars appear to be vey different values, but are not as far apart as the size of the bars makes them appear. 
- There are only two dates to compare, I would rather see the data over a longer period of time to see how man people are enrolling each day (assuming it is people?)
- Perceptual - There are no values on the X and Y axis
- The source is not clear "HHS"
- The year of this chart is not provided. 
- Aesthetic - The two bars are the same colour blue and the background of the figure is a darker shade of blue with some kind of graphic which makes it unpleasant to look at. 


How could this data visualization have been improved?  
- Add a clearer title (what is the "Goal?").
- Add values on the X and Y axis.
- Make it accurately represents the data without bias.
- Add additional data to show the changes over a longer period of time (i.e from start of Obamacare to March 31).
- Elabroate on the source.
- It's not reproducible, but given the topic and source, most of the public is unlikely to look at that.  


--------------------------------------------------
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
